# Stripe Solution Architect Written Project
## Use Case
A family-owned campus bookstore has recently begun selling e-text books to university students, but is currently still doing so out of the brick and mortar store. With a reason and desire to open up selling of these e-books online, they are considering Stripe as a facilitating vendor. However, they are struggling to visualize what the user experience would be and have requested a demo of a similar e-commerce application with the below requirements, details about how the solution was made (and how beginners may replicate it), as well as further improvements that could be offered.

### Requirements
 - [X] The user can select a book to purchase
 - [X] The user can checkout and purchase the item using [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/payments/elements)
 - [X] The user recevies a display confirmation fo purchase with the total of the charge and unique id (in the form of a Stripe Payment Intent ID)

## How to Run the Solution
> **Note:** This solution was made with the [JavaScript (Node.js) boilerplate application](https://github.com/mattmitchell6/sa-takehome-project-node) as its starting point

To get started, clone the repository using the code below (or click "Download ZIP" under the Clone button above), navigate to the appropriate directory, and install the dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/poshprogrammer/stripe && cd-stripe
npm install
```
Then, run the application locally using the code below and access the solution's index at http://localhost:3000
```
npm start
```
## How Does It Work?

## What Was My Approach as a Stripe Beginner?
Given my current solution, ServiceNow, primarily uses JavaScript as its main programming language, I started my solution using the Node.js boilerplate provided in in the instructions. After acquiring a Stripe account (which included the necessary test keys and Doc access), I installed the Stripe CLI with Homebrew and Node.js itself. This combined with the instructions provided in the README got me to the point where the boilerplate accurately ran locally.

From there, I started browsing through the Stripe Docs, familiarizing myself with the APIs and general set up. It was while browing that I came across the ["Prebuilt Checkout page"](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart) Walkthrough, which allowed me to successfully get the first version of my Checkout Session up and running.

Given I had exhausted the lab-type content on the Docs website, I turned to YouTube where I sifted through a variety of videos before settling on the ["Stripe Checkout"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjcSWxPNo18) video from the official Stripe Developers channel. Around 45 minutes in length, it gave a deeply comprehensive overview that I could follow at my own speed. This video got me to a point where I had acheived the remaining customer requirements.

All that remained was figuring out how to dynamically choose the right Price Object to charge and better style the success page.
### Challenges I Encountered

 - **Finding Lab-Type Resources for Enablement:** While Stripe has an *extremely* comprehensive Docs website, I found Stripe lacking in comparison to other vendors with regards to self-paced lab content. For my learning style, this is something I gravitate towards, so found learning the ropes more difficult without it. Luckily, the YouTube content was  a great substitute!
 - **Re-familiarizing Myself With Full-Stack Development:** It has been a long time since my development work has occured outside of the ServiceNow platform, so I had to spend some extra time re-learning certain concepts. Like Celine Deon famously sang, though, ðŸŽ¶ It's all comin' back to me now!  ðŸŽ¶ For example, this showed up in the forms of having to re-figure out how to pass query parameters to client and server.
